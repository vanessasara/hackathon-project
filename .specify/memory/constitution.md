# Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development

All code MUST be generated from specifications using Claude Code. Manual coding is prohibited.

- Every feature MUST have a specification document (`spec.md`) before implementation begins
- Code MUST be generated by Claude Code based on approved specifications
- If generated code does not meet requirements, the specification MUST be refined and regenerated
- Direct code editing is only permitted for critical bug fixes with documented justification

**Rationale**: This hackathon teaches the Architecture of Intelligence—engineers act as system
architects, not syntax writers. Specs ensure reproducibility and AI-native development practices.

### II. Clean Code

All code MUST follow Python conventions and maintain high readability standards.

- Code MUST comply with PEP 8 style guidelines
- All functions and classes MUST have type hints for parameters and return values
- All public functions, classes, and modules MUST have docstrings
- Variable and function names MUST be descriptive and self-documenting
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Imports MUST be organized: standard library, third-party, local

**Rationale**: Clean code reduces cognitive load, enables effective AI code generation, and
ensures maintainability across the 5-phase evolution of this project.

### III. Test-First Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be followed.

- Tests MUST be written before implementation code
- Tests MUST fail before implementation (Red phase)
- Implementation MUST be minimal to pass tests (Green phase)
- Refactoring MUST maintain passing tests (Refactor phase)
- Test coverage MUST include: unit tests for business logic, edge cases, error conditions
- pytest MUST be used as the testing framework

**Rationale**: TDD ensures correctness, provides living documentation, and enables confident
refactoring as the application evolves through all 5 phases.

### IV. Single Responsibility

Each module, class, and function MUST have one clear, well-defined purpose.

- Separate concerns: models (data), manager (business logic), UI (presentation)
- Functions SHOULD do one thing and do it well
- Classes SHOULD have a single reason to change
- Modules SHOULD group related functionality only
- Avoid mixing I/O operations with business logic

**Rationale**: Single responsibility enables independent testing, easier AI code generation,
and smooth evolution from console app to distributed cloud system.

### V. Evolutionary Architecture

Code MUST be structured to support future phases while implementing only current requirements.

- Phase I: In-memory storage with interfaces that abstract storage details
- Design for change: storage layer SHOULD be swappable without modifying business logic
- Avoid premature optimization—implement only what the current phase requires
- Document architectural decisions that affect future phases
- Follow YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) while maintaining clean boundaries

**Rationale**: The project evolves from console app → web app → AI chatbot → Kubernetes →
cloud deployment. Architecture must support this progression without over-engineering early phases.

### VI. User Experience First

All user-facing interfaces MUST prioritize clarity, helpfulness, and intuitive interaction.

- Prompts MUST be clear and indicate expected input format
- Error messages MUST be helpful and suggest corrective actions
- Menu options MUST be numbered and consistently ordered
- Confirmation MUST be shown for destructive actions (delete)
- Success/failure feedback MUST be immediate and unambiguous
- Input validation MUST provide specific feedback on invalid input

**Rationale**: The application will eventually become an AI chatbot. Building UX discipline
from Phase I ensures consistent user experience across all interaction modalities.

## Technology Stack

Phase I requirements—future phases will extend this stack.

- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **Package Manager**: UV
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Storage**: In-memory (list/dictionary)
- **Interface**: Interactive console menu
- **Code Generation**: Claude Code with Spec-Kit Plus

Constraints:
- No external database dependencies in Phase I
- No web frameworks in Phase I
- Standard library preferred; minimize third-party dependencies

## Development Workflow

The Spec-Driven Development workflow MUST be followed for all features:

1. **Constitution** (`/sp.constitution`): Define/update project principles
2. **Specify** (`/sp.specify`): Create feature specification with user stories
3. **Clarify** (`/sp.clarify`): Resolve ambiguities in specifications
4. **Plan** (`/sp.plan`): Generate technical implementation plan
5. **Tasks** (`/sp.tasks`): Break down into actionable, testable tasks
6. **Implement** (`/sp.implement`): Execute tasks using Red-Green-Refactor
7. **Document** (`/sp.adr`): Record architectural decisions when significant
8. **Record** (`/sp.phr`): Create Prompt History Records for traceability

Quality Gates:
- Specification MUST be approved before implementation
- Tests MUST pass before marking task complete
- PHR MUST be created after significant interactions

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other development practices for this project.

**Amendment Process**:
1. Propose amendment with rationale
2. Document impact on existing code/specs
3. Update version according to semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Principle removal or incompatible redefinition
   - MINOR: New principle or section added
   - PATCH: Clarification or typo fix
4. Update dependent templates if affected

**Compliance**:
- All code reviews MUST verify Constitution compliance
- Violations MUST be documented and justified
- Complexity beyond principles MUST be explicitly approved

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-01 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-01
